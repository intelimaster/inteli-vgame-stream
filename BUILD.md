# vgmstream

## Compilation requirements

**GCC / Make**: In Windows this means one of these two somewhere in PATH:
- MinGW-w64 (32bit version): https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/
  - Use this for easier standalone executables
- MSYS2 with the MinGW-w64_shell (32bit) package: https://msys2.github.io/

**MSVC / Visual Studio**: Microsoft's Visual C++ and MSBuild, bundled in either:
- Visual Studio: https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/
  - Visual Studio Community 2015 should work (free, but must register after trial period)
- Visual C++ Build Tools (no IDE): http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools

**Git**: optional, to generate version numbers:
- Git for Windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win

## Compiling modules

### CLI (test.exe) / Winamp plugin (in_vgmstream) / XMPlay plugin (xmp-vgmstream)

**With GCC**: use the *./Makefile* in the root folder, see inside for options. For compilation flags check the *Makefile* in each folder.
You need to manually rebuild if you change a *.h* file (use *make clean*).

In Linux, Makefiles can be used to cross-compile with the MingW headers, but they aren't well prepared to generate native code at the moment. It should be fixable with some effort.

Windows CMD example for test.exe:
```
prompt $P$G$_$S
set PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\usr\bin;%PATH%
set PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\mingw-w64\i686-5.4.0-win32-sjlj-rt_v5-rev0\mingw32\bin;%PATH%

cd vgmstream

mingw32-make.exe mingw_test -f Makefile ^
 VGM_ENABLE_FFMPEG=1 VGM_ENABLE_MAIATRAC3PLUS=0 ^
 SHELL=sh.exe CC=gcc.exe AR=ar.exe STRIP=strip.exe DLLTOOL=dlltool.exe WINDRES=windres.exe
```

**With MSVC**: open *./vgmstream_full.sln* and compile in Visual Studio, or use MSBuild in the command line. See the foobar2000 section for dependencies and CMD examples.


### foobar2000 plugin (foo\_input\_vgmstream)
Requires MSVC (foobar/SDK only links to MSVC C++ DLLs) and these dependencies:
- foobar2000 SDK, in *(vgmstream)/../foobar/*: http://www.foobar2000.org/SDK
- FDK-AAC, in *(vgmstream)/../fdk-aac/*: https://github.com/kode54/fdk-aac
- QAAC, in *(vgmstream)/../qaac/*: https://github.com/kode54/qaac
- WTL (if needed), in *(vgmstream)/../WTL/*: http://wtl.sourceforge.net/

Open *./vgmstream_full.sln* as a base, which expects the above dependencies. Then, depending on your VS version (like VS2015) you may need to manually do the following (in *Debug* and *Release* configurations):
- Change each project's compiler version from VS2010 to your version (right click menu)
- For *foobar2000_ATL_helpers* add *../../../WTL/Include* to the compilers's *additional includes*
- For *foo_input_vgmstream* add *../../WTL/Include* to the compilers's *additional includes*
- For *foo_input_vgmstream* add *../../foobar/foobar2000/shared/shared.lib* to the linker's *additional dependencies*

VS2013 may not be compatible with the SDK in release mode due to compiler bugs.
FDK-AAC/QAAC can be disabled by removing *VGM_USE_MP4V2* and *VGM_USE_FDKAAC* in the compiler/linker options and the project dependencies.


You can also use the command line to compile with MSBuild, if you don't want to touch the .vcxproj files, register VS2015 after trial, or only have VC++/MSBuild tools.

Windows CMD example for foobar2000:
```
prompt $P$G$_$S
set PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\usr\bin;%PATH%
set PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\14.0\Bin;%PATH%

cd vgmstream

set CL=/I"C:\projects\WTL\Include"
set LINK="C:\projects\foobar\foobar2000\shared\shared.lib"

msbuild fb2k/foo_input_vgmstream.vcxproj ^
 /t:Clean

msbuild fb2k/foo_input_vgmstream.vcxproj ^
 /t:Build ^
 /p:Platform=Win32 ^
 /p:PlatformToolset=v140 ^
 /p:Configuration=Release
```

### Audacious plugin
Requires the dev version of Audacious (and dependencies), automake/autoconf, and gcc/make (C++11).

The plugin itself works with Audacious 3.5 or higher. New Audacious releases can break plugin compatibility so it may not work with the latest version unless adapted first.

FFmpeg and other external libraries aren't enabled, thus some formats are not supported. libvorbis and libmpg123 can be disabled with -DVGM_DISABLE_VORBIS and -DVGM_DISABLE_MPEG.

Windows builds aren't supported at the moment (should be possible but there are complex dependency chains).


Terminal example, assuming a Ubuntu-based Linux distribution:
```
# get libraries
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install audacious

sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install gcc g++ make
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool
sudo apt-get install audacious-dev libmpg123-dev libvorbis-dev libglib2.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev libpango1.0-dev

# check audacious version
pkg-config --modversion audacious

git clone https://github.com/kode54/vgmstream
cd vgmstream


# build
./bootstrap
./configure
make -f Makefile.audacious

# copy to audacious plugins
sudo make -f Makefile.audacious install


# post-cleanup
make -f Makefile.audacious clean
find . -name ".deps" -type d -exec rm -r "{}" \;
./unbootstrap
## WARNING, removes *all* untracked files not in .gitignore
git clean -fd
```

## Development

### Structure
vgmstream uses C89 when possible (so VS2010 can compile it), and C++ for the foobar2000 and Audacious plugins.

```
./                   docs, scripts
./audacious/         Audacious plugin
./ext_includes/      external includes for compiling
./ext_libs/          external libs/DLLs for linking
./fb2k/              foobar2000 plugin
./src/               main vgmstream code and helpers
./src/coding/        format data decoders
./src/layout/        format data demuxers
./src/meta/          format header parsers
./test/              test.exe CLI
./winamp/            Winamp plugin
./xmplay/            XMPlay plugin
```

### Overview
vgmstream works by parsing a music stream header (*meta/*), reading/demuxing data or looping (*layout/*) and decoding the compressed data into listenable PCM samples (*coding/*).

Very simplified it goes like this:
- player (test.exe, plugin, etc) inits the stream *[main]*
- init tries all parsers (metas) until one works *[init_vgmstream]*
- parser reads header (channels, sample rate, loop points) and set ups a VGMSTREAM struct + layout/coding, if the format is correct *[init_vgmstream_(format-name)]*
- player gets total_samples to play, based on the number of loops and other settings *[get_vgmstream_play_samples]*
- player asks to fill a small sample buffer *[render_vgmstream]*
- layout prepares bytes to read from the stream *[render_vgmstream_(layout)]*
- decoder decodes bytes into PCM samples *[decode_vgmstream_(coding)]*
- player plays those samples, asks to fill sample buffer, repeats (until total_samples)
- layout moves back to loop_start when loop_end is reached *[vgmstream_do_loop]*

### Adding new formats
For new simple formats, assuming existing layout/coding:
- *src/meta/(format-name).c*: create new format parser that reads all needed info from the stream header and inits VGMSTREAM
- *src/meta/meta.h*: register parser's init
- *src/vgmstream.h*: register new meta
- *src/vgmstream.c*: add parser init to the init list
- *src/formats.c*: add new extension to the format list, add meta description
- *fb2k/foo_vgmstream.cpp*: add new extension to the file register list (optional)
- *src/libvgmstream.vcproj/vcxproj/filters*: add to compile new (format-name).c parser in VS
- if the format needs an external library don't forget to mark optional parts with: *#ifdef VGM_USE_X ... #endif*

# TXTH FORMAT

TXTH is a simple text file that uses text commands to simulate a header for files unsupported by vgmstream, mainly headerless audio.

When an unsupported file is loaded (for instance "bgm01.snd"), vgmstream tries to find a TXTH header in the same dir, in this order:
- (filename.ext).txth
- .(ext).txth
- .txth

If found and parsed correctly (the .txth may be rejected if incorrect commands are found) vgmstream will try to play the file as described. Extension must be accepted/added to vgmstream (plugins like foobar2000 only load extensions from a whitelist in formats.c), or one could rename to any supported extension (like .vgmstream), or leave the file extensionless.

You can also use ".(sub).(ext).txth" (if the file is "filename.sub.ext"), to allow mixing slightly different files in the same folder. The "sub" part doesn't need to be an extension, for example:
- 001.1ch.str, 001.1ch.str may use .1ch.txth
- 003.2ch.str, 003.2ch.str may use .2ch.txth
- etc

## Example of a TXTH file
For an unsupported bgm01.vag this would be a simple TXTH for it:
```
id_value = 0x534E4420       #test that file starts with "SND "
id_offset = @0x00:BE        #test is done at offset 0, big endian value
codec = PSX                 #data uses PS-ADPCM
sample_rate = @0x10$2       #get sample rate at offset 0x10, 16 bit value
channels = @0x14            #get number of channels at offset 14
interleave = 0x1000         #fixed value
start_offset = 0x100        #data starts after exactly this value
num_samples = data_size     #find automatically number of samples in the file
loop_flag = auto            #find loop points in PS-ADPCM
```
A text file with the above commands must be saved as ".vag.txth" or ".txth", notice it starts with a "." (dot). On Windows files starting with a dot can be created by appending a dot at the end: ".txth."


## Available commands

The file is made of lines with `key = value` commands describing a header. Commands are all case sensitive and spaces are optional: `key=value`, `key  =   value`, and so on are all ok. Comments start with # and can be inlined.

The parser is fairly simple and may be buggy or unexpected in some cases. The order of keys is variable but some things won't work if others aren't defined (ex. bytes-to-samples may not work without channels or interleave).

# HEADER/BODY SETTINGS [OPTIONAL]
# Changes internal header/body representation to external files.
#
# TXTH commands are done on a "header", and decoding on "body".
# When loading an unsupported file it becomes the "base" file
# that loads the .txth, and is both header and body.
#
# You can alter those, mainly for files that split header and body
# in separate files (load base file and txth sets header on another file).
# It's also possible to load the .txth directly with a set body, as a sort of
# "reverse TXTH" (useful with bigfiles, as you could have one .txth per song).
#
# Allowed values:
# - (filename): open any file, subdirs also work (dir/filename)
# - *.(extension): opens with same name as the "base" file plus another extension
# - null: unloads file and goes back to defaults (body/header = base file).

# SUBSONGS [OPTIONAL]
# Sets the number of subsongs in the file, adjusting reads per subsong N:

# Mainly for bigfiles with consecutive headers per subsong, set subsong_offset
# to 0 when done as it affects any reads.

# NAMES [OPTIONAL]
# Sets the name of the stream, most useful when used with subsongs.
# TXTH will read a string at name_offset, with name_size characters.
# name_size defaults to 0, which reads until null-terminator or a
# non-ascii character.
# name_offset can be a (number) value, but being an offset it's also
# adjusted by subsong_offset.

# SUBFILES [OPTIONAL]
# Tells TXTH to parse a full file (ex. .ogg) at subfile_offset, with size
# of subfile_size (defaults to file size - subfile_offset if not set).
# Internal subfile extension can be changed to subfile_extension if needed,
# as vgmstream won't accept unknown extensions (for example if your file 
# uses .pogg you may need to set subfile_extension = ogg).
# Setting any of those three will trigger this mode (it's ok to set offset 0).
# Once triggered most fields are ignored, but not all, explained below.

# CHUNK DEINTERLEAVING [OPTIONAL]
# Some files interleave raw data chunks, for example 3 stereo songs pasted together,
# alternating 0x10000 bytes of data each. These settings allow vgmstream to play
# one of the chunks while ignoring the rest (read 0x10000 data, skip 0x10000*2).
# File is first "dechunked" then played with using other settings (start_offset
# would points within the internal "dechunked" file).
#
# You need to set:
# - start: where all chunk data start (normally 0x00)
# - size: amount of data in a single chunk (ex. 0x10000).
# - count: total number of interleaved chunks (ex. 3=3 interleaved songs)
# - number: first chunk to start (ex. 1=0x00000, 2=0x10000, 3=0x20000...)
# If you set subsong_count first chunk_number will be a set per subsong.

```

## Usages

### Temporary values
Most commands are evaluated and calculated immediatedly, every time they are found. This is by design, as it can be used to adjust and trick for certain calculations.

It makes TXTHs a bit harder to follow, as they are order dependant, but otherwise it's hard to accomplish some things or others become ambiguous.


For example, normally you are given a data_size in bytes, that can be used to calculate num_samples for all channels.
```
channels = 2
sample_type = bytes
num_samples = @0x10     #calculated from data_size
```

But sometimes this size is for a single channel only (even though the file may be stereo). You can set temporally change the channel number to force a correct calculation.
```
channels = 1            #not the actual number of channels
sample_type = bytes
num_samples = @0x10     #calculated from channel_size
channels = 2            #change once calculations are done
```
You can also use:
```
channels = 2
sample_type = bytes
num_samples = @0x10 * channels  # resulting bytes is transformed to samples
```

Do note when using special values/strings like `data_size` in `num_samples` and `loop_end_samples` they must be alone to trigger.
```
data_size = @0x100
num_samples = data_size * 2 # doesn't tranform bytes-to-samples (do it before? after?)
```
```
data_size = @0x100 * 2
num_samples = data_size     # ok
```
Also beware of order:
```
start_offset = 0x200        # recalculated data_size
num_samples = data_size     # transforms bytes-to-samples
data_size = @0x100          # useless as num_samples is already transformed
```


### Redefining values
Some commands alter the function of all next commands and can be redefined as needed:
```
samples_type = bytes
num_samples = @0x10

samples_type = sample
loop_end_sample = @0x14
```

### External files
When setting external files all commands are done on the "header" file, but with some creativity you can read in multiple files.
```
body_file = bgm01.bdy
header_file = bgm01.hdr
channels = @0x10        #base info in bgm01.hdr
header_file = bgm01.bdy
coef_offset = 0x00      #DSP coefs in bgm01.bdy
```
Note that DSP coefs are special in that aren't read immediately, and will use *last* header_file set.


### Resetting values
Values may need to be reset (to 0 or other sensible value) when done. Subsong example:
```
subsong_count = 5
subsong_offset = 0x20   # there are 5 subsong headers, 0x20 each
channel_count = @0x10   # reads channels at 0x10+0x20*subsong
# 1st subsong: 0x10+0x20*0: 0x10
# 2nd subsong: 0x10+0x20*1: 0x30
# 2nd subsong: 0x10+0x20*2: 0x50
# ...
start_offset = @0x14    # reads offset within data at 0x14+0x20*subsong

subsong_offset = 0      # reset value
sample_rate = 0x04      # sample rate is the same for all subsongs
# Nth subsong ch: 0x04+0x00*N: 0x08
```

### Math
Sometimes header values are in "sectors" or similar concepts (typical in DVD games), and need to be adjusted to a real value.
```
sample_type   = bytes
start_offset  = @0x10 * 0x800    # 0x15 * DVD sector size, for example
```

You can also use certain fields' values:
```
num_samples = @0x10 * channels  # byte-to-samples of channel_size
```
`data_size` is a special value for `num_samples` and `loop_end_sample` and will always convert as bytes-to-samples, though.


Priority is left-to-right. Do add brackets though, they are accounted for and if they are implemented in the future your .txth *will* break with impunity.
```
# normal priority
data_size = @0x10 * 0x800 + 0x800
# also works
data_size = (@0x10 + 1) * 0x800
# same as above but don't do this
# (may become @0x10 + (1 * 0x800) in the future
data_size = @0x10 + 1 * 0x800
# doesn't work at the moment, so reorder as (1 * 0x800) + @0x10
data_size = @0x10 + (1 * 0x800)
# fails, wrong bracket count
data_size = (@0x10 + 1 * 0x800
# fails, wrong bracket count
data_size = )@0x10 + 1 * 0x800
```

If a TXTH needs too many calculations it may be better to implement directly in vgmstream though, consider reporting.


### Modifiers
Remnant of simpler math (priority is fixed to */+-), shouldn't be needed anymore.

```
value_multiply = 0x800
start_offset   = @0x10
value_multiply = 0
```

```
value_add = 1
channels = @0x08
value_add = 0

value_multiply = channels
sample_type = bytes
num_samples = @0x10
value_multiply = 0
```

```
value_add       = 0x10
value_mul       = 0x800
start_offset    = @0x10
```

### Subfiles
Sometimes a file is just a wrapper for another common format. In those cases you can tell TXTH to just play the internal format:
```
subfile_offset = 0x20   # tell TXTH to parse a full file (ex. .ogg) at this offset
subfile_size = @0x10    # defaults to (file size - subfile_offset) if not set
subfile_extension = ogg # may be ommited if subfile extension is the same

# many fields are ignored
codec = PCM16LE
interleave = 0x1000
channels = 2

# a few fields are applied
sample_rate = @0x08
num_samples = @0x10
loop_start_sample = @0x14
loop_end_sample = @0x18
```
Most fields can't be changed after parsing since doesn't make much sense technically, as the parsed subfile should supply them. You can supply them when using bytes-to-samples conversions, though.
```
# parses subfile at start
subfile_offset = 0x20
# force recalculation of num_samples
codec = PSX
start_offset = 0x40
num_samples = data_size
```

### Chunks
Chunks affect some values (padding size, data size, etc) and are a bit sensitive to order at the moment, due to technical complexities:
```
# Street Fighter EX3 (PS2)

# base config is defined normally
codec       = PSX
sample_rate = 44100
channels    = 2
interleave  = 0x8000

# set subsong number instead of chunk_number for subsongs
subsong_count = 26
#chunk_number = 1
chunk_start = 0
